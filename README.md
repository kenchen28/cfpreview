# cfpreview

This App Builder example pulls Content Fragments from AEM and displays them in different layouts.

## Setup

- Populate the `.env` file in the project root and fill it as shown [below](#env)
- Within the AEM UI, configure a Persisted Query that returns that conforms with the default data in App.js
- Edit the Content Fragment Model Default Preview URL Pattern to point to the path to this deployed app. eg https://experience.adobe.com/#/@myorg/custom-apps/myappname?cf=${contentFragment.path}&variation=${contentFragment.variation}

## Local Dev

- `aio app run` to start your local Dev server
- App will run on `localhost:9080` by default

By default the UI will be served locally but actions will be deployed and served from Adobe I/O Runtime. To start a
local serverless stack and also run your actions locally use the `aio app run --local` option.

## Deploy & Cleanup

- `aio app deploy` to build and deploy all actions on Runtime and static files to CDN
- `aio app undeploy` to undeploy the app

## Config
